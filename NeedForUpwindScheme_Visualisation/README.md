# Need for Upwind Scheme: A visualisation

Need for upwind scheme in numerical solutions for advection-diffusion type problems is illustrated with the solution of 1-D steady state axial convection-diffusion slug flow problem.The below library shows the exact solution and the Finite Difference Scheme solution for different ranges of peclet number


## Getting started 

The repository can be cloned and the library `Visualise.py` can be simply executed for the visualisation

### Prerequisites 

The library uses the following two python libraries

* numpy
* math
* matplotlib

### Problem statement
